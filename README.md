# Customer Relationship Management (CRM) System
This project focuses on developing a CRM system to bolster customer relationships via modules like analysis and customer service. It incorporates page permission control, limiting access to authorized pages through user group management. The system furnishes a unified customer profile, housing demographic data, purchase history, and habit analysis, including featured products and average monthly purchase amounts. Additionally, it offers promotion management features for creating, modifying, and delivering promotions, along with monitoring customer responses and analyzing feedback. Furthermore, the CRM web application includes an interface for addressing and monitoring customer complaints. Here are some snapshots of the project
